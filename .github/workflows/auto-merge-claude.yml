# SINGLE WORKFLOW for merge + all deploys
#
# Why one file instead of separate workflows per deploy type:
#   - The merge into main MUST happen first and only once. Separate workflows
#     would each need the merge step, creating a race condition (two workflows
#     trying to merge the same branch simultaneously).
#   - Splitting would require a shared merge workflow + workflow_run triggers,
#     adding complexity for no benefit.
#   - Each deploy step is already independent and conditional (only runs when
#     its files changed), so it behaves like separate deploys within one pipeline.
#   - Adding a new GAS project = adding one more conditional step. Simple.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Push to claude/* branch triggers this workflow
#   2. Merge into main (once)
#   3. Check what changed (git diff)
#   4. Deploy GAS projects — only if their Code.gs was modified
#   5. Delete the claude branch
#   6. Deploy GitHub Pages — only if httpsdocs/ files were modified
#   7. Direct pushes to main skip merge and just deploy
#
# HOW TO ADD A NEW GAS PROJECT:
#   1. Create a folder in googleAppsScripts/ (e.g. "My New Project")
#   2. Put Code.gs inside it with its own VERSION, FILE_PATH, SCRIPT_ID,
#      DEPLOYMENT_ID, etc. pointing to the new Apps Script project
#   3. The new GAS project must have doPost(action=deploy) deployed manually
#      the first time (bootstrap — copy-paste Code.gs into the Apps Script editor)
#   4. Add a new step in the auto-merge job BEFORE "Delete branch", using this template:
#
#      - name: Deploy My New Project
#        run: |
#          git diff --name-only HEAD~1 HEAD | grep -q "googleAppsScripts/My New Project/Code.gs" && \
#          curl -L -X POST \
#            "https://script.google.com/macros/s/DEPLOYMENT_URL_HERE/exec" \
#            -d "action=deploy" \
#            --max-time 120 || true
#
#   5. Replace DEPLOYMENT_URL_HERE with the project's web app deployment URL
#   6. That's it — the step only runs when that project's Code.gs changes
