# SINGLE WORKFLOW for merge + all deploys
#
# Why one file instead of separate workflows per deploy type:
#   - The merge into main MUST happen first and only once. Separate workflows
#     would each need the merge step, creating a race condition (two workflows
#     trying to merge the same branch simultaneously).
#   - Splitting would require a shared merge workflow + workflow_run triggers,
#     adding complexity for no benefit.
#   - Each deploy step is already independent and conditional (only runs when
#     its files changed), so it behaves like separate deploys within one pipeline.
#   - Adding a new GAS project = adding one more conditional step. Simple.
#
# Flow:
#   1. Push to claude/* branch triggers this workflow
#   2. Merge into main (once)
#   3. Check what changed (git diff)
#   4. Deploy GAS projects — only if their Code.gs was modified
#   5. Delete the claude branch
#   6. Deploy GitHub Pages — only if httpsdocs/ files were modified
#   7. Direct pushes to main skip merge and just deploy
